# Development Guidelines

This project uses **AGENTS.md** as the primary developer documentation. Before starting any task:

1. Read AGENTS.md for:
   - Project structure and architecture
   - Code standards and conventions
   - Feature-specific implementation guides
   - Development workflow and testing requirements

2. Consult the `docs/` directory for detailed feature documentation

All development guidelines, patterns, and best practices are documented in AGENTS.md.
