1. Always use AGENTS.md (usually in root folder) to get context
2. Always update to AGENTS.md when you finish a task. Make the update, if any, as concise as possible. Trim any unnecessary details.
3. After creating an implementation plan, update docs/implementation-plans/ with a new file that is time-stamped with the plan.
4. If git commit message is blank, add one after completing a fix, feature etc., but do not commit.
