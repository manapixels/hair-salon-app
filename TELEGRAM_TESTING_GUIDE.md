7. Click **[✅ Yes, book it!]**

## 🔧 Debugging Tips

### Check Booking Context

```typescript
// Add temporary logging in botCommandService.ts
const context = getBookingContext(userId);
console.log('Current booking context:', JSON.stringify(context, null, 2));
```

### Check Telegram Webhook Logs

```bash
# View webhook delivery status
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getWebhookInfo

# Check for pending updates
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates
```

### Database Inspection

```bash
# Connect to database
npx prisma studio

# Or run SQL directly
psql $DATABASE_URL
SELECT * FROM appointments WHERE "customerEmail" = 'test@example.com';
```

### Clear Context Manually

```typescript
// In Node.js console or temporary endpoint
import { clearHistory, clearBookingContext } from './src/services/conversationHistory';
clearHistory('TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID');
clearBookingContext('TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID');
```
