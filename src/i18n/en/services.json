          "question": "How long does a perm last?",
          "answer": "A perm lasts 6-8 months on average, though results vary based on hair growth rate, texture, and how you care for it. The curls will gradually loosen over time but remain until you cut the permed hair off or grow it out. Digital perms tend to last slightly longer due to the heat-setting process."

        {
          "question": "What's the difference between a digital perm and classic perm?",
          "answer": "A digital perm uses heated rods and creates loose, natural-looking waves that mimic heat-styled curls. It works best on medium to long hair. A classic (cold) perm uses room-temperature rods and creates more defined, tighter curls that are springier when wet. Digital perms tend to look more natural and modern."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I perm colored or bleached hair?",
          "answer": "It's possible, but we need to carefully assess your hair's condition first. Perming already chemically-treated hair carries higher risk of damage. We typically recommend waiting 2-3 weeks between coloring and perming, and may suggest strand tests or bond-building treatments. Very damaged or over-processed hair may not be suitable for perming."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will a perm damage my hair?",
          "answer": "Perming is a chemical process that alters hair structure, so some stress is inevitable. However, using quality Korean or Japanese perm solutions, proper technique, and post-perm care minimizes damage. We don't recommend perming severely damaged hair. Regular deep conditioning treatments will help maintain hair health."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I style permed hair?",
          "answer": "The beauty of a perm is minimal styling! After washing, apply curl-enhancing mousse or cream to damp hair, scrunch upward, and either air-dry or diffuse on low heat. Avoid brushing dry permed hair (use fingers or a wide-tooth comb). Refresh curls between washes with a spray bottle and curl cream."

After 3 days, avoid high heat styling, chlorinated water, and tight hairstyles. Always use sulfate-free products formulated for chemically treated hair."

      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "How long does keratin treatment last?",
          "answer": "Keratin treatments typically last 3-5 months, gradually fading over time as you wash your hair. Unlike rebonding, keratin doesn't create a harsh regrowth line—it simply reverts to your natural texture. Results last longer with sulfate-free products and less frequent washing."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between keratin treatment and rebonding?",
          "answer": "Keratin is a temporary smoothing treatment (3-5 months) that reduces frizz and adds shine while maintaining some natural movement. Rebonding is a permanent chemical straightening process that creates pin-straight hair lasting 6-8 months with only root regrowth. Keratin is gentler and more reversible, while rebonding is more dramatic and permanent."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I get keratin treatment on colored or bleached hair?",
          "answer": "Yes! Keratin treatment is actually beneficial for colored or bleached hair, as it helps seal the cuticle and restore smoothness. We recommend waiting 1-2 weeks after coloring for best results. The treatment can help extend color vibrancy by reducing porosity."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will keratin treatment make my hair completely straight?",
          "answer": "No—keratin reduces frizz and smooths hair but doesn't eliminate curls or waves entirely. You'll retain natural movement and body, just in a more controlled, polished form. If you want completely straight hair, rebonding would be more appropriate."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I avoid after keratin treatment?",
          "answer": "For the first 3 days, avoid washing hair, tying it up, or using clips/headbands. After that, use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, minimize heat styling, and avoid chlorinated water. These precautions help extend the life of your treatment."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is your keratin treatment different from at-home products?",
          "answer": "Professional keratin uses higher-quality formulas with controlled application and heat-sealing techniques that ensure even distribution and longer-lasting results. At-home treatments lack the professional heat-sealing step and often provide more temporary results (4-6 weeks vs. 3-5 months)."

Many clients notice improved hair thickness and reduced shedding with regular treatments. For significant hair loss concerns, we recommend consulting a dermatologist."

In fact, scalp treatments can help maintain color vibrancy by creating a healthier environment for hair growth and reducing the need for harsh clarifying shampoos."
