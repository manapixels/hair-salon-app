            "question": "Will colouring damage my hair?",
            "answer": "Our gentle, low-ammonia Japanese formulas are designed to minimize damage while delivering beautiful results. We also include conditioning treatments to protect and nourish your hair during the colouring process. However, any chemical process does affect hair structure, which is why we recommend regular deep conditioning treatments."

          {
            "question": "Can I color my hair if it's already been treated?",
            "answer": "Yes, but we need to assess your hair's condition first. If you've recently had other chemical treatments like perms or relaxers, we may recommend waiting or using alternative colouring methods. During your consultation, please inform us of any previous treatments."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I choose the right color?",
            "answer": "We'll help you select the perfect shade based on your skin tone, eye color, lifestyle, and maintenance preferences. We'll show you color swatches and can perform a strand test if you're unsure. We recommend bringing inspiration photos to your consultation."
          },
          {
            "question": "What's the difference between root touch-up and full color?",

          {
            "question": "How long does a perm last?",
            "answer": "A perm lasts 6-8 months on average, though results vary based on hair growth rate, texture, and how you care for it. The curls will gradually loosen over time but remain until you cut the permed hair off or grow it out. Digital perms tend to last slightly longer due to the heat-setting process."
          },
          {
            "question": "What's the difference between a digital perm and classic perm?",
            "answer": "A digital perm uses heated rods and creates loose, natural-looking waves that mimic heat-styled curls. It works best on medium to long hair. A classic (cold) perm uses room-temperature rods and creates more defined, tighter curls that are springier when wet. Digital perms tend to look more natural and modern."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I perm colored or bleached hair?",
            "answer": "It's possible, but we need to carefully assess your hair's condition first. Perming already chemically-treated hair carries higher risk of damage. We typically recommend waiting 2-3 weeks between coloring and perming, and may suggest strand tests or bond-building treatments. Very damaged or over-processed hair may not be suitable for perming."
          },
          {
            "question": "Will a perm damage my hair?",
            "answer": "Perming is a chemical process that alters hair structure, so some stress is inevitable. However, using quality Korean or Japanese perm solutions, proper technique, and post-perm care minimizes damage. We don't recommend perming severely damaged hair. Regular deep conditioning treatments will help maintain hair health."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I style permed hair?",

Avoid brushing dry permed hair (use fingers or a wide-tooth comb). Refresh curls between washes with a spray bottle and curl cream."

          {
            "question": "How long does keratin treatment last?",
            "answer": "Keratin treatments typically last 3-5 months, gradually fading over time as you wash your hair. Unlike rebonding, keratin doesn't create a harsh regrowth line—it simply reverts to your natural texture. Results last longer with sulfate-free products and less frequent washing."
          },
          {
            "question": "What's the difference between keratin treatment and rebonding?",
            "answer": "Keratin is a temporary smoothing treatment (3-5 months) that reduces frizz and adds shine while maintaining some natural movement. Rebonding is a permanent chemical straightening process that creates pin-straight hair lasting 6-8 months with only root regrowth. Keratin is gentler and more reversible, while rebonding is more dramatic and permanent."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I get keratin treatment on colored or bleached hair?",
            "answer": "Yes! Keratin treatment is actually beneficial for colored or bleached hair, as it helps seal the cuticle and restore smoothness. We recommend waiting 1-2 weeks after coloring for best results. The treatment can help extend color vibrancy by reducing porosity."
          },
          {
            "question": "Will keratin treatment make my hair completely straight?",
            "answer": "No—keratin reduces frizz and smooths hair but doesn't eliminate curls or waves entirely. You'll retain natural movement and body, just in a more controlled, polished form. If you want completely straight hair, rebonding would be more appropriate."
          },
          {
            "question": "What should I avoid after keratin treatment?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Will scalp treatment help with hair loss?",
            "answer": "While scalp treatments can't reverse genetic hair loss, they create optimal conditions for hair growth by improving blood circulation, removing buildup that blocks follicles, and delivering nutrients to the scalp. Many clients notice improved hair thickness and reduced shedding with regular treatments. For significant hair loss concerns, we recommend consulting a dermatologist."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is scalp treatment suitable for sensitive scalps?",
            "answer": "Yes! We can customize treatments specifically for sensitive scalps using gentle, soothing formulas without harsh ingredients. Let us know about your sensitivity during consultation so we can select the most appropriate products and techniques."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I get a scalp treatment if I have colored hair?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. Scalp treatments focus on the scalp and roots rather than the hair lengths, and we use color-safe products. In fact, scalp treatments can help maintain color vibrancy by creating a healthier environment for hair growth and reducing the need for harsh clarifying shampoos."
          },
          {
            "question": "What's the difference between regular and advanced scalp therapy?",
            "answer": "Our regular Scalp Treatment provides deep cleansing and general scalp health maintenance using quality formulas. The Advanced Scalp Therapy uses premium formulas specifically targeting concerns like hair loss, severe dandruff, or extreme oiliness, and includes optional treatment ampoule boosts for intensified results."
