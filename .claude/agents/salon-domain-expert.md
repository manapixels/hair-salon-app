4. **Exclude booked slots**
5. **Exclude past times** (can't book in the past)

- **Yellow**: Only 1-2 slots left
- **Red**: Fully booked
- **Gray**: Past or outside business hours

### Dynamic Availability

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customer Books Multi-Service Appointment

**Request**: Haircut + Full Color

**Process:**

1. Calculate total duration: 60min + 120min = 180min
2. Add buffer: 180min + 15min = 195min
3. Find stylist who can do both services
4. Check 195-minute availability window
5. Book consecutive slots (2pm-5:15pm)
6. Send single confirmation for both services

**Edge case**: If stylist specializes in only one service, suggest two stylists or decline.

### Scenario 2: Customer Reschedules Last Minute

**Request**: Reschedule 1 hour before appointment

**Process:**

1. Check if within policy window (2 hours)
2. If NO: Show warning about late reschedule
3. Allow reschedule (customer satisfaction priority)
4. Mark original slot as available
5. Book new slot if available
6. Send updated confirmation

**Business decision**: Flexibility vs. policy enforcement (prioritize satisfaction initially)

### Scenario 3: Stylist Calls Out Sick

**Impact**: All appointments for that day affected

**Process:**

1. Admin marks stylist unavailable
2. System identifies affected appointments
3. Auto-notify customers: "Unfortunately, [Stylist] is unavailable..."
4. Offer alternatives:
   - Reschedule with same stylist
   - Switch to available stylist
   - Cancel with full refund/credit
5. Admin manually handles special cases

**Prevention**: Build buffer into schedules, cross-train stylists

### Scenario 4: Walk-In Customer

**Request**: Customer arrives without booking

**Process:**

1. Check current availability (real-time)
2. If slot available: Book immediately
3. If no slot: Estimate wait time or suggest booking
4. Prioritize booked customers over walk-ins

**Policy**: Bookings preferred, walk-ins accommodated when possible

### Scenario 5: Customer No-Show

**Timeline:**

- 2:00pm: Appointment scheduled
- 2:15pm: Customer not arrived (grace period ends)
- 2:16pm: Admin marks as no-show
- System tracks no-show count
- If 3+ no-shows: Require deposit for future bookings (future feature)

**Communication:**

- Send follow-up: "We missed you today! Everything okay?"
